#### What is it?

QuickSearch is a small plugin which adds an extension to the part search function on the editor, it also adds a search parts on the tech tree.

#### What is the search extension?

By default, the search extension is enabled, and with it you can:
* search with regex 				/ab/,
* make a AND 					a&b,
* make a OR 					a|b,
* make a NOT 					!a,
* search a word begin 				(ab or "ab,
* search a word end 				ab) or ab",
* search a word 				(ab) or "ab",
* search only the tag				%ab,
* search only the name 				;ab,
* search only the title 			:ab,
* search only the description			-ab,
* search only the author			,ab,
* search only the manufacturer			?ab,
* search only the part size			.ab,
* search only the resources			+ab,
* search only the tech required			@ab,
* search only the module			_ab,
a and b are the search example, all the shortcut can be edited on the config file.
At this time, you can only cumulate AND, OR, NOT, words begin/end/full, but not with others shortcut.
