#### What is it?

QuickMute is a plugin which adds the possibility to mute all the KSP sounds.

#### How does it work?

You have three solutions to use QuickMute:
* push on F6,
* with the stock toolbar,
* with the Blizzy Toolbar (an optional mod).

You can change the shortcut and enable/disable toolbar's icons on the file "GameData/QuickMute/Config.txt"

#### How to install it?

Unzip all files. Put the QuickMods folder in your KSP/GameData folder.

#### How to update it?

Unzip all files. Merge the new QuickMods folder with the old folder which is in your KSP/GameData folder.

#### How to uninstall it?

Delete the QuickMods/QuickMute folder in your KSP/GameData folder.
